In the observable Universe, It seems inconceivable that at least one of these planets does not have a life form on it; in fact, the best educated guess we can make using the little that we do know about the conditions for carbon-based life, leads us to estimate that perhaps one in 100,000 stars might have a life-bearing planet orbiting it.

Much of the money in this project is being spent on developing the special hardware needed to search many frequencies at once.

superior adjective (BETTER)
C1 ​better than ​average or ​better than other ​people or things of the same ​type:

The stars being searched are hundreds of light years away. so it takes hundreds of years for their signal to reach us, and a further few hundred years for our reply to reach them. It's not important, then, if there’s a delay of a few years, or decades, while the human race debates the question of whether to reply and perhaps carefully drafts a reply.
